# bubblehelp
A manager to render, contextualize and manage BubbleTea (https://github.com/charmbracelet/bubbletea) keybinds globally

# Introduction
When working on a complex application in the terminal, it's important to have a good
way of managing multiple contexts with different keybinds, same keys but different outcome,
and so on.

I was facing troubles, when trying to manage dynamic keybinds and on top of that the need
of rendering help. The BubbleTea library is amazing, but it lack something to manage the
keybinds well.

That's why I've created bubblehelp. It's just a coat of quality of life to help you write
contextualized TUI application with complex ever-changing help for your users.

Take a look at the example and let your imagination do the rest.
